abstract = {Properties of chambers made of planes of independent wires placed between two plane electrodes have been investigated. A direct voltage is applied to the wires. It has been checked that each wire works as an independent proportional counter down to separations of 0.1 cm between wires. Counting rates of 105/wire are easily reached; time resolutions of the order of 100 nsec have been obtained in some gases; it is possible to measure the position of the tracks between the wires using the time delay of the pulses; energy resolution comparable to the one obtained with the best cylindrical chambers is observed; the chambers operate in strong magnetic fields.}
